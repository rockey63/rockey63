   Abstract={Geocoding, the process of translating addresses to geographic coordinates, is a relatively straight-forward and well-studied process, but limitations due to privacy concerns may restrict usage of geographic data. The impact of these limitations are further compounded by the scale of the data, and in turn, also limits viable geocoding strategies. For example, healthcare data is protected by patient privacy laws in addition to possible institutional regulations that restrict external transmission and sharing of data. This results in the implementation of "in-house" geocoding solutions where data is processed behind an organization's firewall; quality assurance for these implementations is problematic because sensitive data cannot be used to externally validate results. In this paper, we present our software framework called bench4gis which benchmarks privacy-aware geocoding solutions by leveraging open big data as surrogate data for quality assurance; the scale of open big data sets for address data can ensure that results are geographically meaningful for the locale of the implementing institution.},

   Abstract={To evaluate the impact of the 12 January 2010 earthquake on HIV cases from Haiti's national HIV surveillance system and assess the characteristics of people living with HIV 1-year before and after the earthquake.\\ An interrupted time-series design and cross-sectional analysis.\\ We used autoregressive integrated moving average structures to model abrupt changes to the monthly, incident HIV case counts from HIV care clinics as reported to the Haitian Active Longitudinal Tracking of HIV System (French acronym SALVH) by clinical networks (n = 3) and earthquake instrumental intensity zones (n = 4). Preearthquake and postearthquake differences in patient-level characteristics including clinical values were examined using the Ï‡ test, t tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\\ In the month immediately following the earthquake, all three clinical networks experienced statistically significant declines in cases reported: iSantÃ© (-31.4%), Groupe HaÃ¯tien d'Etude du Sarcome de Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes (-29.9%) and Zamni Lasante (-32.2%). Zone 8 (the most severe) was the only area with a statistically significant decline (-45.5%). Of the three clinical networks, only iSantÃ© returned to preearthquake reporting levels by the end of our study period. Patient-level characteristics did not change dramatically after the earthquake.\\ Despite case reporting declines, especially in clinics near the earthquake epicenter, SALVH remained intact with less impact than expected. This national system is a critical component of Haiti's strategic health information system initiative and plays a central role to HIV monitoring and evaluation efforts.},

   Abstract={Gabapentin is prescribed for a variety of conditions and is often used off label. It is important to understand the prevalence of gabapentin prescribing and the characteristics of individuals who are prescribed gabapentin, given increasing concern regarding its potential for misuse.\\ To (a) examine state- and region-level prevalence and trends in gabapentin prescribing from 2009 to 2016 and (b) characterize demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals prescribed gabapentin in a nationwide population of commercially insured adults.\\ This retrospective, longitudinal study examined trends in gabapentin prescribing from 2009 to 2016. The study population included individuals aged 18-64 years who were enrolled in a commercial insurance plan at any point from 2009 to 2016. Individuals who were prescribed gabapentin were defined as beneficiaries with at least 1 gabapentin prescription claim in a calendar year (CY). A cross-sectional descriptive analysis was performed to examine differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals prescribed or not prescribed gabapentin in CY 2016.\\ The prevalence of gabapentin prescribing nearly doubled from 2009 to 2016. During this time, gabapentin prescribing increased in every state (range: 44%-179%). State-specific prevalence rates in 2016 varied from 12.7 to 43.9 per 1,000 beneficiaries. Overall, 2.7% of beneficiaries filled â‰¥ 1 gabapentin prescription in 2016. Individuals prescribed gabapentin were more likely to fill opioid prescriptions (60.8% vs. 16.5%, P < 0.01); reside in the South (53.7% vs. 47%, P < 0.01); be female (62.5% vs. 52.3%, P < 0.01); and be aged 55-64 years (41.7% vs. 21.2%, P < 0.01) compared with the comparator. Individuals who were prescribed gabapentin also had significantly higher rates of seizure disorders, neuropathic pain, mental health disorders, substance use disorders, and diabetes.\\ The prevalence of gabapentin prescribing among a U.S. privately insured population has increased steadily in recent years. Additional research should examine coprescribing of gabapentin in the context of the opioid epidemic.\\ The project described in this study was supported by the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences through grant number UL1TR001998.

   Abstract={To test whether Medicaid expansion is associated with (a) a greater number of naloxone prescriptions dispensed and (b) a higher proportion of naloxone prescriptions paid by Medicaid.\\ We used the IQVIA National Prescription Audit to obtain data on per state per quarter naloxone prescription dispensing for the period 2011-16.\\ In this quasi-experimental design study, the impact of Medicaid expansion on naloxone prescription dispensing was examined using difference-in-difference estimation models. State-level covariates including pharmacy-based naloxone laws (standing/protocol orders and direct authority to dispense naloxone), third-party prescribing laws, opioid analgesic prescribing rates, opioid-involved overdose death rates, and population size were controlled for in the analysis.\\ Medicaid expansion was associated with 38 additional naloxone prescriptions dispensed per state per quarter compared to nonexpansion controls, on average (P = .030). Also, Medicaid expansion resulted in an average increase of 9.86 percent in the share of naloxone prescriptions paid by Medicaid per state per quarter (P < .001).\\ Our study found that Medicaid expansion increased naloxone availability. This finding suggests that it will be important to consider naloxone access when making federal- and state-level decisions affecting Medicaid coverage.},

   Abstract={Increased prevalence of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs has contributed substantially to overdose deaths in the United States (1-3). On October 26, 2015, CDC issued a Health Advisory regarding rapid increases in deaths involving fentanyl. This CDC Health Advisory has been updated twice to address increases in fentanyl and fentanyl analog overdoses and their co-occurrence with nonopioids (4). Deaths involving carfentanil, an analog reportedly 10,000 times more potent than morphine and 100 times more potent than fentanyl, were first reported in Florida, Michigan, and Ohio in 2016 and described in an August 2016 CDC Health Advisory (1,5). Carfentanil is used to rapidly immobilize large animals in veterinary medicine and has no U.S. approved therapeutic use in humans. Carfentanil's street price per dose is likely lower than that of heroin. During 2016 and 2017, an outbreak of carfentanil-involved fatal overdoses in Florida emerged, and the Medical Examiner jurisdiction serving Sarasota, Manatee, and DeSoto counties (the Sarasota area) was the outbreak epicenter. This report describes toxicology profiles, sociodemographic information, and geographic distributions of carfentanil-involved fatal overdoses (carfentanil deaths) in the Sarasota area compared with those in the rest of Florida (i.e., all Florida counties excluding Sarasota area) from January 2016 to December 2017. The Sarasota area accounted for 19.0% of 1,181 statewide carfentanil deaths that occurred during this time and experienced a peak in carfentanil deaths preceding the larger Florida outbreak. The report of a single carfentanil death from August to December 2017 (compared with 73 reported deaths during the same period in 2016) appeared to mark the end of the outbreak in the area. The threat of such rapid, intense fatal overdose outbreaks highlights the need for accelerated reporting, reliable data sharing systems, and novel proactive surveillance to support targeted prevention and response efforts by public health and safety organizations (6).},

   Abstract={The recent opioid prescribing guideline cautions about the concomitant prescribing of opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) given the additive central nervous system depressant effect. However, the clinical relevance remains unclear. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared the risk of opioid overdose associated with concomitant use of opioids and SMRs vs. opioid use alone. Adjusted hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74-1.62) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00-1.58) in the incident and prevalent opioid user cohorts, respectively, generating a combined estimate of 1.21 (95% CI, 1.00-1.48). This risk seemed to increase with treatment duration (â‰¤ 14 days: 0.91 and 95% CI, 0.67-1.22; 15-60 days: 1.37 and 95% CI, 0.81-2.37; >60 days: 1.80 and 95% CI, 1.30-2.48) and for baclofen (1.83 and 95% CI, 1.11-3.04) and carisoprodol (1.84 and 95% CI, 1.34-2.54). Concomitant users with daily opioid dose â‰¥50 mg (1.50 and 95% CI, 1.18-1.92) and benzodiazepine use (1.39 and 95% CI, 1.08-1.79) also had elevated risk. Clinicians should be cautious about these potentially unsafe practices to optimize pain care and improve patient safety.},

   Abstract={The rapidly expanding size of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database requires modernized pharmacovigilance practices. Techniques to systematically identify high utility individual case safety reports (ICSRs) will support safety signal management.\\ The aim of this study was to develop and validate a model predictive of an ICSR's pharmacovigilance utility (PVU).\\ PVU was operationalized as an ICSR's inclusion in an FDA-authored pharmacovigilance review's case series supporting a recommendation to modify product labeling. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between PVU and ICSR features. The best performing model was selected for bootstrapping validation. As a sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the model's performance across subgroups of safety issues.\\ We identified 10,381 ICSRs evaluated in 69 pharmacovigilance reviews, of which 2115 ICSRs were included in a case series. The strongest predictors of ICSR inclusion were reporting of a designated medical event (odds ratio (OR) 1.93, 95% CI 1.54-2.43) and positive dechallenge (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.50-1.87). The strongest predictors of ICSR exclusion were death reported as the only outcome (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.76-4.35), more than three suspect products (OR 2.69, 95% CI 2.23-3.24), and > 15 preferred terms reported (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.90-3.82). The validated model showed modest discriminative ability (C-statistic of 0.71). Our sensitivity analysis demonstrated heterogeneity in model performance by safety issue (C-statistic range 0.58-0.74).\\ Our model demonstrated the feasibility of developing a tool predictive of ICSR utility. The model's modest discriminative ability highlights opportunities for further enhancement and suggests algorithms tailored to safety issues may be beneficial.},

   Abstract={High-risk combinations of controlled medications, such as those involving opioid analgesics, are under increased scrutiny because of their contribution to the opioid epidemic in the United States. Responsible prescribing guidelines indicate that the triple drug combination--opioids, benzodiazepines and skeletal muscle relaxants, especially carisoprodol--should not be concurrently prescribed.\\ This pharmacoepidemiologic study was designed to primarily examine the characteristics of patients receiving this triple combination compared to the group receiving only opioids and benzodiazepines.\\ Results show that, while the number of exposed patients has declined since 2012, approximately 17,000 Floridians were prescribed this combination in 2017 alone. Demographically, recipients of these prescriptions were younger, more likely to be female, and geographically-localized. Furthermore, these patients were more frequently associated with a prescriber in the top 1% of opioid and/or benzodiazepine prescribing, have more multiple provider episodes ("doctor shopping"), and receive higher mean daily opioid dosages.\\ These findings raise important questions as to how frequently prescribers are checking prescription drug monitoring programs, following US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opioid prescribing guidelines, and/or handling the clinical challenges associated with pharmaceutical management of patients with complex, painful health conditions.},
